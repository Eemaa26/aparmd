## Introduction

Introductory section which may include references in parentheses
\parencite{R}, or cite a reference such as \textcite{R} in the text.

## Section title in sentence case

This section may contain a figure such as Figure \ref{figure:rlogo}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=1.5in]{Rlogo}
  \caption{The logo of R.}
  \label{figure:rlogo}
\end{figure}

### A subsection

There will likely be several sections, perhaps including code snippets, such as:

```{r}
x <- 1:10
x
```

#### Linear Regerssion

We can model heart weight (in grams) from body weight (in kilograms) using the `cars` data in the `MASS` package.

$$Hwt = Bwt * b_1 + b_0$$

The results of this regression model are summarized in Table \ref{lmtable}.

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='hide'}
library(MASS)
library(xtable)
data(cats)
lm.out <- lm(Hwt ~ Bwt, data=cats)
```

##### Table Results

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
xtable(lm.out, caption='Linear Regression Results', label='lmtable')
```

##### Plots

It is also useful to include a scatter plot as in Figure \ref{figure:scatter}.

```{r scatterplot, echo=FALSE, results='hide', results='asis', caption='Scatter Plot of Head versus Body Weight'}
plot(cats$Bwt, cats$Hwt)
```
